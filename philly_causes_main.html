            <p><br>One in 45 children experience homelessness in America each year.
                That's over 1.6 million children.  While homeless, they experience high
                rates of acute and chronic health problems.  The constant barrage of stressful
                and traumatic experience also has profound effects on their development and ability
                to learn.</p>

            <p> <br>
                Today, the number of children (under age 18) in the United States is at an all-time
                high of 74.2 million. But, the share of the national population who are children is
                at an all time low.
                America's homeless children are mostly unseen, but they are counted. The troubling
                part is that these numbers have been climbing for some time now. In the 2011 school year,
                enrollment statistics in preschools and K-12 programs reported a figure of 1,168,354
                children known to be homeless.</p>
