<p class="image-content">One out of every 30 children in the U.S. experienced homelessness last year.
    That makes nearly 2.5 million children who, in 2013, lived in shelters, on the streets,
    in cars, on campgrounds or doubled up with other families in tight quarters, often moving
    from one temporary solution to another, according to “America’s Youngest Outcasts,” a report
    published Monday by the the National Center on Family Homelessness at the American Institutes
    for Research.
    <br>
    <br>
    With an increase of 8 percent in just one year between 2012 and 2013, the number of homeless
    children in this country has reached a historic high, the report says.
    <br>
    <br>
    “As a nation of wealth and opportunity [one in 30 children] is not something we should tolerate,”
    Carmela DeCandia, director of the National Center on Family Homelessness, tells Newsweek. “We haven’t
    been paying attention,” she says, and “we need to before the goal becomes out of reach.”</p>
